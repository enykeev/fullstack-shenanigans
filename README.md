# Full-stack shenanigans

I realized that in a past few years working in the same company that I grew attached to a particular stack of technologies and rarely have a need and opportunity to go outside of this stack. This repo is a collection of services interacting with each other. They are not designed to be production ready services, but they still suppose to serve a certain function and be generally useful under a certain set of trade-offs I should be able to reason about.
